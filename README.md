This repository serves as a collection of all my Computer Science work done at Grand Valley State University. Each class is seperated into folders with their respective class numbers. Everything in this repository is completely original work by me, unless otherwise stated in the code.

### Course overviews
- CIS 162
  - This class is Computer Science I. It is the first introductory class into CS. It consists of rigorious use of Java, as well as 5 projects. The complexity of the projects increase constantly throughout the semester.
- CIS 163
  - This class is Computer Science II. It is very similiar to Computer Science I, with more exploration of Java and more difficult projects.
