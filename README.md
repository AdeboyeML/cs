Homework Assignment #1 for CIS-343 by AJ Natzic

Git provides a few commands that will help me to collaborate with others, as well as update pre-existing code. For example, one of the commands I can use is git push origin <branch name>. This command will alow me to push a new branch to github, combining the pre-existing code from master with the new code from <branch name>. Another useful command is  git branch -b <branch name>. This command automatically creates a new branch in the repository, meaning that I can safely work on code from the master files in this new branch without worrying about messing up old code. Finally, one more useful command is the git pull origin <branch name> command. This command will allow me to recieve the changes made on github onto my local machine, allowing me to edit the repository on my computer.
